This directory contains a demonstration of running the linear model using an analytical linearisation state.

This example is run in the rose test suite as part of the 'canned test'.

It can also be run from the command line as follows.
1. Build the linear model (in the linear directory, 'make build')
2. Run the linear model (in the linear/example_cannedtest directory, '../bin/linear configuration.nml')
