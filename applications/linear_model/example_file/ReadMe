This directory contains a demonstration of running the linear model using a linearisation state that is first created by running the nonlinear model.

1. Build gungho (in the gungho directory, 'make build')
2. Build linear (in the linear directory, 'make build')
3. Run the nonlinear model (in the linear/example_file directory, '../../gungho_model/bin/gungho_model config_nonlinear.nml')
4. Create the linearisation state file ('. create_ls_file.sh')
5. Run the linear model (in the linear/example_file directory, '../bin/linear_model config_linear.nml')
