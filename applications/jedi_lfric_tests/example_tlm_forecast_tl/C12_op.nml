!--------------------------------------------------------------------
! Example namelists for mesh generation
!--------------------------------------------------------------------
! These example namelists will result in the mesh generators
! producing an output file (<mesh_file_prefix>) which will
! contain <n_meshes> mesh topologies which are identified by
! the by <mesh_names>.
!
! Additional intergrid mappings may be produced and included
! in the output file. Each map is specified by an item in the
! <mesh_maps> list. Maps are specified by a string of the two
! mesh names spearated by a ":". Each item will cause a
! map to be added to the maps source mesh, i.e.
!
! 'C12:C24' will result in a map added to the
!
!  *  "C12" mesh (source) object mapping to "C24"  (target)
!  *  "C24"  mesh (source) object mapping to "C12" (target)
!
! Notes:
!  *  Only the first "n_meshes" listed in mesh_names will be
!     output in the mesh file.
!  *  All spherical co-ordinates are given the order
!     [longitude, latitude] in the units, degrees_east, degrees_north
!     respectively

! Cubedsphere Meshes: Only used by the Cubedsphere mesh generator
!==================================================================
! Each cubesphere mesh is specified by the corresponding number of
! cells on a panel edge. These are listed in the variable <edge_cells>
! and correspond to the order of names given by <mesh_names>.
!
! Any smoothing iterations specified will be applied to all meshes
! requested. Smoothing is experimental (especially with regards to
! intergrid mesh maps) is advised to be left as 0 for general use.
